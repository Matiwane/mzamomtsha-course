<p style = "color: blue;"> On the this day the school will be having a prayer day.<br>
   We have prayer days at the beginning of the terms. <br>
   We have 4 terms so that means there will be 4 prayer days in a year. This brings us(school) close to<br>
   God. We ask him to guide us through the term.

 <img src = "marathon.jpeg" width = "30%" height = "30%" style = "float: right;"/>
<p style = "color: blue;"> As we all know that exercise is good for our bodies.<br>
   We have a Sport day during the first term. All leraners are required<br> to participate.
   This helps those who are really good in athletes and would want to make a carrer out of it.
